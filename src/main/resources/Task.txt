Create a generic class to implement a league table for any type of sport.
The class should allow teams to be added to the list, and store a list of teams that belong to this particular league.

Your class should have a method to print out the teams by name alphabetical.
Only teams of the same type should be added to any particular instance of the league class - the program should fail to compile if an
attempt is made to add an incompatible team.
